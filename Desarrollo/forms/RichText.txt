RichText.exe is a sample that demonstrates much of the functionality of the Rich Textbox
control as used within Microsoft Visual FoxPro. Most of the properties are documented in
this sample, with the exception of the OLE properties and the Tabs collection, among others.

While the Rich Textbox control can be used with earlier versions of Visual FoxPro, 
some of the supporting code in this sample was not in the language prior to 
Visual FoxPro 6.0, and some of the properties may not have been in the control. 
The code can be modified as necessary in other versions. 

To use this example, do the following: 

1. Run RichText.exe to unzip the files.

2. In the Visual FoxPro Command window, go to the directory where you unzipped the file.

3. Type DO FORM RichText.

When you are in the form, you have a RichText edit area along with controls to set text
properties. Most of them operate on the current selection, so you need to select 
some of the text before you see any effect. 

Click on the Bold, Italic, and other format buttons to toggle the appearance of the text. 
Do the same for the Bullet button. Note, however, the bullet indent property only 
takes effect when you turn the bullet on. If you change this after bulleting a 
paragraph, you do not see anything change. 

Maximum Length and Current Length apply to the whole document, not just the selection.

The Save File and Load File buttons allow you to save the contents of the 
Rich Text control as an .rtf file and to load .txt or .rtf files into the control.

The Protected checkbox allows you to set part of the text as unchangeable in any way. 
This prohibits change when any of the protected text is selected. It can also be 
set to change only the unprotected text, but this involves bit more work.

The Offset spinner allows you to move text above and below the baseline, so you 
could do supescripts and subscripts.

Several properties that can only be set at design time have their values displayed 
on the form.
